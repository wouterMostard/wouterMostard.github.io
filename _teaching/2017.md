A first year undergraduate course in robots

Description
======

At the end of the course, the student is able to:
* Explain meaning of different concepts often used in the field of robotics.
* Explain workings of common methods used in robotics and perform experiment with 2 different computer applets (Braitenberg Vehicles and Markov Localization).
* Explain techniques from Evolutionary Computation and perform experiment with computer applet (Genetic Algorithms).
* Explain general workings of Machine Learning algorithms.
* Explain the concepts used in Artificial Life and the way complex behavior emerges from simple rules and perform experiments with 2 different computer applets (Boids and Cellular Automata).
